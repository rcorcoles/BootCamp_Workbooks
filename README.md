Week 2 focused on **Power BI and Tableau** for data analysis and visualization. The week included a comparison of **Tableau versions**, highlighting key features, connectivity options, capabilities, and differences between free and paid editions.<br><br>Hands-on exercises in Tableau included generating a **UK-based map** to visualize locations affected by job changes, producing multiple visualizations from a **Spotify dataset** to gain insights, and analyzing **health data** to explore relationships between metrics such as BMI and cholesterol and their impact on life expectancy. Additionally, **Power BI Desktop** was used to complete three labs from the **PL-300 certification**, reinforcing skills in data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation. 

## Week 3 – SQL

Week 3 focused on **SQL Server and database concepts**. The week began with an overview of databases, covering key features such as **primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, and relationships**. Differences between **relational and non-relational databases** were explored, including structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data, along with the benefits of each type.<br><br>Hands-on activities included writing **SQL queries** to extract data from sample datasets using various **joins** (inner, outer, full). Groups also prepared a **500-word essay** detailing how a small retail shop could design a database for products, suppliers, and customer information, along with a **small ERD** to highlight key relationships and SQL implementation. Finally, a set of **20 queries** was completed using the **world_db** database, demonstrating a range of SQL syntax, conditions, and data filtering techniques. 

## Week 5 – Azure
